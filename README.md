This repository is part of an on-going Capstone Project for the Certificate in Data Analytics Big Data and Predictive Analytics at Ryerson University (Toronto - Canada). 

## Introduction

Stock Market forecast has always been a common interest in the financial market. Several methods involving statistical, technical analysis are daily applied towards defining trading strategies for long or short periods. With the develop of Neural Networks algorithms, many advents of trying to use this technology have been studied to increase predictionâ€™s accuracy and stability. 

Cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoins, have been the focus of many traders for the past few years. Having a volatile trading history with high price increases and drops in 2013 and 2018.  Typical trading strategies can involve buying and selling during medium to long periods, e.g days and weeks. Other type of strategy, is performing operations within each day, i.e intraday or day trading. The later benefits from short-term price fluctuation typically using periods of one, five, fifteen, thirty and sixty minutes. 

The objective of this project is to verify to what extent can applying Neural Networks help forecast the next minutes of Bitcoin prices within a day fluctuation, using previous data and statistical indicators.
